Privacy Policy for GlowSell

GlowSell does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or non-personal data with the developer or third parties.

All app features run entirely on your device. Any data you create or save in GlowSell remains local to your device unless you choose to enable iCloud sync.

GlowSell uses iCloud solely to sync and back up your saved data across your own Apple devices. This data is stored in your personal iCloud account and is managed by Apple under Apple’s privacy and security policies. GlowSell does not have access to, collect, or control any iCloud-stored data.

GlowSell does not use analytics services, tracking technologies, advertising networks, or third-party data collection tools.

GlowSell does not require account registration and does not request personal information.

Because no data is collected or shared by the developer, your privacy is fully respected.

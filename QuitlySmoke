Effective Date: December 21, 2025

QuitlySmoke (“we,” “our,” or “the app”) respects your privacy. We want to be clear: **QuitlySmoke does not collect, store, or share any personal information or usage data from users.**

1. No Data Collection
QuitlySmoke works fully offline and does **not collect any personal data**, usage data, or device information. Everything you do in the app stays on your device unless you choose to use cloud sync.

2. Optional Cloud Sync
The app can optionally use iCloud to synchronize user-generated data (such as progress, settings, or content) across your devices. This data is **controlled by you**, used only for app functionality, and **is not shared with anyone else**, nor used for advertising or tracking.

3. No Third-Party Services
QuitlySmoke does not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only external service is iCloud, and only for optional user data sync.

4. Children’s Privacy
QuitlySmoke does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. All data remains under the user’s control.

5. Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be posted here. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
